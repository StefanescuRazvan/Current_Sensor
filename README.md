# Current_Sensor

## Overview
This project is a portable current monitoring system that measures and displays electrical current and power consumption. It uses an SCT-013 current sensor, an LM358 operational amplifier, an ESP32 microcontroller, and a TFT display for real-time data visualization. Additionally, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connectivity allows data transmission to a custom mobile application.

## Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Displays current and power consumption on a TFT display.
- **Bluetooth Connectivity**: Transmits data to a mobile app for graphical visualization.
- **Custom Mobile App**: Built using MIT App Inventor, the app plots current waveforms over time.
